## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Coding style

### HTML & CSS

Refer to the [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html).

### JavaScript

## Contributing

The base workflow is as follows:
Create New Branch -> Make Changes -> Commit/Push Changes to Your Local Branch -> When Done With Yor Work, Submit Pull Request and Request Review From Relevant Teammate -> Get Feedback -> Make Changes To The Branch If Necessary (Do NOT Open a New Pull Request) -> Get Merge Approval -> Merge Your Branch with Master -> Rinse and Repeat

Additionally, here are some essential tips for making your contributions professional and clear:

- When making a new branch, title it after the feature/task you are working on. Do not title branches after your name or other non-descriptive things. The goal of the title should be to communicate to your teammates what the branch is for and, hopefully, hint at the files that were changed.
- Ideally, each commit should be entirely self contained and only affect one part of the codebase. It's not the end of the world if multiple changes are a part of the same commit, but generally speaking the more the commit changes the functionality of the website, the more important it is to have it be it's own thing.
- When you are done working on your branch, open a pull request and (unless it's something tiny like a readme edit) request a teammate to review your changes and merge the branch into master.
- **Do not** push to master directly. The only exceptions to this are (1) README edits, (2) documentation updates and (3) typo fixes.
- As the saying goes, _"measure twice, cut once"_. Before finalizing any contribution, always double check your work and make sure you did not break anything in the process. Some of the things you should verify are (1) does the server run, (2) do all the pages load properly and (3) does the feature you were working on function as expected. If they are available, run all the tests before submiting a pull request.

All version control is done with Git. If you are new, we recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRQoVRzMIY) video for a basic introduction. Additionally, [this](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) official github guide serves as a good introduction to the basics of the git workflow.
